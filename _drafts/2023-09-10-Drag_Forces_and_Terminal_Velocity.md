# Terminal Velocity in Skydiving

The concept of terminal velocity is intuitive when considering skydiving. That is, after a person jumps off a plane, they accelerate until their drag force is equivalent to their force of gravity.

\notag
\begin{equation}
F_{drag } = F_{gravity} 
\end{equation}
$$




No net forces act on the skydiver and so, according to Newtons first law: "an object in motion will continue in motion". 

There are other applications of terminal velocity governed by the same principle but differing mechanics that are interesting.

Lets assume that this object is in a state of Stokes flow.
